<p>
  This is component is using the shadow dom. While it is not
  <a class="text-primary" href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdomv1">supported in most browsers</a> yet, we use it here to demonstrate how dynamic theming (doesn't) work with shadow dom.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shadow DOM provides style encapsulation
    <br/>
    <small>it doesn't inherit styles from the shadow host, nor does it inluence the shadow host with its own styles</small>
  </li>
  <li>Shadow DOM does inherit CSS Variables</li>
  <li>Shadow DOM does inherit styling from the hosting body</li>
  <li>New specs are on their way to allow for theming elements in the shadow dom (::part and ::theme)</li>
  <li>It will require a significant change from UI libraries to come up with an approach to support shadow DOMs</li>
</ul>
